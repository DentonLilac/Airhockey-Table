//Project requires the FastLED library in order to function. FastLED written by Daniel Garcia and Mark Kriegsman.

//Contained code is not a prime example of optimal coding techniques, forewarning.

//Designed to run on an Arduino Mega 2560 R3, but a more powerful processor would be more useful for the computationally expensive LED effects.
